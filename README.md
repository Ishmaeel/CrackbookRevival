Crackbook
=========

See http://xkcd.com/862/

This is a Chrome extension for discouraging the compulsive use of
attention-sucking websites.  The main idea of the extension is that delaying
access to the website is more effective than straight blocking because you
are less likely to just disable the block after a while.

After you browse websites from a predefined list for a while, the extension
will remind you a few times to stop wasting time, and afterwards it will
start blocking each junk page for half a minute.  The timer is reset if you
switch away from the tab, so you actually have to wait it out.

Unless disabled in settings, the extension will collect and anonymously
submit usage data. Aggregate statistics are available at
<http://crackbook.info>.

The junk page counter resets daily.


The extension is available on the Chrome Store at:
https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nbgjmohekjolcgemlolblankocjlgalf

The source code is available under the MIT license (see the file LICENSE).
