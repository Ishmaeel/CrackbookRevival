Crackbook
=========

See http://xkcd.com/862/

Crackbook is a Chrome extension for discouraging use of attention-sucking
websites such as Facebook or Reddit. The idea behind Crackbook is that delaying
access to the website is more effective than straight blocking because you
are less likely to just disable the block after a while.

The extension will delay every hit to blacklisted site. The delay is just
a few seconds initially, but it increases slightly on every hit.

Unless disabled in settings, the extension will collect and anonymously
submit usage data. Aggregate statistics are available at
<http://crackbook.info>.

The junk page counter resets daily.


The extension is available on the Chrome Store at:
https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nbgjmohekjolcgemlolblankocjlgalf

The source code is available under the MIT license (see the file LICENSE).
It is hosted at http://github.com/gintas/crackbook (patches welcome!).
