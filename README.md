Crackbook is a Chrome extension for discouraging use of attention-sucking
websites such as Facebook or Reddit. The idea behind Crackbook is that delaying
access to the website is more effective than straight blocking because you
are less likely to just disable the block after a while.

The extension will delay every hit to blacklisted site. The delay is just
a few seconds initially, but it increases slightly on every hit.
