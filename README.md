Crackbook
=========

A Chrome extension for discouraging the use of attention-sucking websites.

First you will have to specify domains of distracting sites. Then, after
you browse them for a while the extension will remind you a few times to stop
wasting time, and after a while it will start blocking each junk page for one
minute. The junk counter resets daily.
