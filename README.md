Crackbook
=========

A Chrome extension for discouraging the compulsive use of attention-sucking
websites.  The main idea of the extension is that delaying access to the
website is more effective than an outright ban because you are less likely
to just disable the block after a while.

After you browse websites from a predefined list for a while, the extension
will remind you a few times to stop wasting time, and afterwards it will
start blocking each junk page for one minute. The junk counter resets daily.
